## Logging Patch // No Owner

Logging commands such as 

- `logserver` 
- `logignore` 
- `logevents`
- `log` 

can function without Owner and only require Server Administrator (Ability) Permission.

File changed:
 - `NadekoBot/NadekoBot.Core/Modules/Administration/LogCommands.cs`

`UPDATE: Works with v2.23.0`
